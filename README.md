# SudChiamaNord-QuizOnTheRoad

Quiz on the Road allows you to participate in the team competition organized by the Missionary SudChiamaNord NPO.

The game is similar to a treasure hunt to play in the car in order to reach cities of your province.

Each car is associated with the phone number of the team leader used to provide the team with clues about places to reach and the evidence that the team will have to overcome in order to accumulate points. The foreman, again using his smartphone, should send the test result which may be of different types (video/photo/audio/text).
